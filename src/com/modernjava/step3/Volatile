What is volatile

volatile keyword in Java is used as a indicator toJava compiler  and thread that do not cache value of this variable
and always read it from the main memory

                Main Memory

            variable variable variable variable variable


    Cache v v v v v
        CPU 1
        Thread 1              Cache v v v v v
                                      CPU 2
                                      Thread 2
                thread Engine


1.variable can be defined as volatile method and classes cannot be volatile
2.Volatile keywords guarantee that the variable will be read from main meonory and not from the thread local cache
3.In java reads and write are atomic for all the variables declared volatile
4. If the variable is not used dont use volatile
7.Cache is faster than ram

Question1 ::

In the scenario where one thread is writing to a variable and other thread is just reading
volatile help in the correct visibility of the value of the varibale.
But volatile is not enough in many threads are reading anf writing the value of shared variable
in that case because of race condition thread will still get wrong value
