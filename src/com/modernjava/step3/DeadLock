DeadLock

It is a situation in which threads are waiting for each other to release the lock
There may be situation where thread is waiting for an object lock,
that is accquired by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is accquired by first thread
Since both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock the condition is called deadlock

LiveLock

It is like deadlock in the sense that two or more processes are blocking each other but with livelock
each process is actively trying to resolve the problem on its own like reverting back or retry .
A livelock happens when the combination of these processes efforts to resolve the problem make it impossible
for them to ever terminate

An example of livelock
a husband and wife are trying to eat soup but only have one spoon between them Each spouse  is too polite
and will pass the spoon if the other has not yeteaten

two people attempting to pass each other in corridor
