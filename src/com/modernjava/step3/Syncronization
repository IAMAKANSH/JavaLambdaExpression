java synchronization  provides capabilities to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource

Why????


1.To prevent interferences from multiple threads
2.To avoid consistency issues

Thread Syncronization

type::

1. Mutual Exclusive
->Synchronized method
->Synchronized block
->Static synchronization
2.Cooperation(Inter-thread communication)
->wait
->notify
->notifyAll


Mutual Exclusive


Synchronization is the modifier in java which is used for mutual exclusive lock. With the help of
synchronization modifier we can restrict a shared resource to be accessed by only one thread .

Three are three ways to use synchronized modifier:

1. Synchronized method:
2.Synchronized block
3.static synchronization


If an  object or a block is declared as synchronized than only one thread can access that object or block
at a time. No other thread can take the object or block until it is available

Intrinsic Lock

Every object in JVM has internally a lock.
Synchronized keyword tries to acquire the lock of the target object
