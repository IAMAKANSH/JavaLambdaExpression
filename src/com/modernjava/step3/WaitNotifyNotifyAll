Wait,Notify,NotifyAll are used  for threads communication via a common object
this common object is considered a medium for inter thread via these methods

These methods need to be called from synchronized context, otherwise an exception
IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown

wait()
->When you call wait on the object it tells the thread to give up the lock and go to sleep
state until some other threads enters in same monitor and call notify or notify all

notify()
When you call notify on the obejct it wakes one thread waiting for the object
If multiple threads are wauiting for the object it will call one of them Depending on the
OS implementation it will call one of the waiting thread
